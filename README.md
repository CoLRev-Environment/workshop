# CoLRev workshop

TODOs

- [ ] JP: cheatsheet
- [ ] GW: check whether commands work (pdf-get, IEEE, backward search)
- [ ] Release (after 0.12.2) to make fixes in AIS available via pypi

## Session

Time (45-50 minutes):

- Intro slides (including init): 10 min (max)
- 3 Tasks: 3x(9+2) = 33
- Last slide / questions: 3 min

Notes:

- When people enter the room: assign badges (depending on experience) and match people with high and low experience to work together
- Use full commands (colrev search --add instead of -a)
- Remember: "git reset --hard ..." is not available in the git-graph plugin (must be done via the cli)
